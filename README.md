# PunchIt!

PunchIt! is a simple service for tracking users in an office. They can punch in and out using simple strings like "IN" and "OUT going for lunch".

Part of the idea of this is that potentially it can be hooked up to twitter or some other messaging service to easily do updates.

# Collaboration:

Additionally, you can update the status of other members. This is a philosophical choice because the natural reaction is to secure everything so only the user herself can update their status. However, the goal here is to make a useful tool that people can work together on, so they can do something like "IN back from lunch WITH: jonny jessy brad".
